# Week 01 Progress (Days 0–7)

---

# Day 0 – Setup and First Steps 🚀
- Set up **Python** and **PyCharm IDE** on my system. ⚡  
- Successfully ran my very first Python program:
    ```python
  print("Hello, World!")
    ```

# Day 1 – Python Basics 📘
📅 2025-08-25  

### 📚 Learned
- `print()` with `sep`, `end`, and **f-strings**  
- Core data types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, `None`  
- Operators: arithmetic, comparison, logical, bitwise  
- Type casting (`int()`, `float()`, `str()`, `bool()`)  
- User input with `input()` and conversions  

### 💡 Key Takeaway
`input()` always returns a string → convert for math.  
**f-strings** are the cleanest way to format output.

# Day 2 – Control Flow 🎯
📅 2025-08-26  

### 📚 Learned
- Conditionals: `if`, `elif`, `else`, nested & shorthand  
- Loops: `while`, `for`, `range()`, iterating over strings/lists/dicts  
- Loop controls: `break`, `continue`, `pass`  

### 💡 Key Takeaway
Branching (`if`) + Repetition (`for/while`) = core logic control.  

### 📝 Practice
- Number classification, star patterns, multiplication table, string reversal.

# Day 3 – Strings Deep Dive & Pattern Practice 🔄
📅 2025-09-01  

### ⏸️ Note
Took a short break for a few days—back today with a revision and catch-up session!

### 📚 Learned & Revised
- **String slicing & indexing**: Accessing and manipulating substrings
- **String methods**: `lower()`, `upper()`, `strip()`, `replace()`, `split()`, `join()`, `find()`, `count()`, `startswith()`, `endswith()`, `capitalize()`, `title()`, `isalpha()`, `isdigit()`, `isalnum()`, etc.
- **Escape characters & raw strings**: Handling special characters in strings
- **String concatenation & repetition**
- **String formatting**: f-strings, `.format()`, `%` operator
- **Useful built-in functions**: `abs()`, `round()`, `min()`, `max()`, `sum()`, `len()`, `enumerate()`, `zip()`, `sorted()`, `reversed()`
- **Pattern printing with loops**: Square, triangles, diamond, hourglass, butterfly, and more
- **Best practices**: Naming, code style, and documentation

### 💡 Key Takeaway
Reinforced the basics, filled gaps from Days 1–2, and got comfy with strings and loop patterns.

### 📝 Practice
- Wrote and refactored classic pattern printing programs
- Practiced string manipulations and explored more built-in functions
- Reviewed and improved code style and documentation

# Day 4 – Lists Mastery & Advanced Tips 📝  
📅 2025-09-02  

### 📚 Learned & Practiced  
- List creation, indexing, slicing, and mutability  
- Adding/removing items: `append()`, `insert()`, `extend()`, `remove()`, `pop()`, `del`, `clear()`  
- List comprehensions, sorting, copying, joining, and nested lists  
- Useful methods: `count()`, `index()`, `reverse()`  
- Advanced: negative indices, list multiplication, batch deletion, unpacking, `zip()`, shallow vs deep copy  
- Practice: aggregation, filtering, flattening, removing duplicates, and more

### 💡 Key Takeaway  
Deepened understanding of Python lists and edge cases.

# Day 5 – Tuples: Fundamentals & Advanced Usage 📝  
📅 2025-09-04  

### 📚 Learned & Practiced  
- Tuple creation, indexing, slicing, and immutability  
- Tuple unpacking (basic and extended)  
- Looping through tuples (for, while)  
- Joining, repeating, and tuple methods (`count()`, `index()`)  
- Tuple vs List: key differences and use cases  
- Nested tuples and tuple conversion  
- Built-in functions: `len()`, `min()`, `max()`, `sum()`  
- Real-world examples: function returns, coordinates, dictionary keys  
- Advanced: named tuples, `zip()`, `enumerate()`, nested unpacking, generator expressions  
- Practice exercises for hands-on learning

# Day 6 – Dictionaries & Sets Mastery 🧭
📅 2025-09-18  

### 📚 Learned & Practiced  
- Dictionaries: creation (literals, dict(), zip, fromkeys), access ([], get), update/insert, removal (pop, popitem, del, clear), iteration (keys, values, items), comprehensions, merging (|, |=), nested dicts, shallow vs deep copy, useful methods (get, setdefault, update), and collections tools (defaultdict, Counter).
- Sets: creation (set literals, set()), uniqueness, membership, set algebra (union, intersection, difference, symmetric diff), relations (subset, superset, disjoint), mutating ops (add, update, remove, discard, pop, clear), in-place ops (|=, &=, -=, ^=), comprehensions, frozenset, and common patterns (dedupe, tag overlap).

### 💡 Key Takeaway  
Dicts and sets power fast lookups and clean data transforms.

# Day 7 – Functions & Iteration (Beginner) ✅
📅 2025-09-19  

### 📚 Learned & Practiced  
- Functions: define/call, return values, positional/keyword/defaults, *args/**kwargs in simple words, unpacking during calls.
- Iteration: iterable vs iterator, iter()/next(), simple generators with yield, generator expressions, safe slicing from infinite streams.

### 💡 Key Takeaway  
Write reusable functions and loop over data with confidence.
