# Day 1: Python Basics  
ðŸ“… Date: 2025-08-25  

### ðŸ“š What I Learned
- Using `print()` with `sep`, `end`, and f-strings.  
- Variables and data types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, `None`.  
- Operators: arithmetic, comparison, logical, bitwise.  
- Type casting and `bool()` behavior with strings/numbers.  
- Taking user input (`input()`) and converting it to int/float.  

### ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaway
`input()` always returns a string â†’ must convert for math.  
Also, f-strings make printing much cleaner.
