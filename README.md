# 🐍 My Python Learning Journey

This repository is my **daily log of learning Python**.  
Every day, I create a new folder with the programs I wrote and track my progress through weekly summaries.  

## 📌 How It Works
- Each folder = one week of learning with daily subfolders (`Week 01/Day01/`, `Week 01/Day02/`, …)  
- `Progress.md` = overview of my weekly progress
- Weekly progress files (`Week-01_Progress.md`, etc.) = detailed daily notes for that week
- Code inside each day's folder = the exercises, examples, or mini-programs I practiced  

📖 Check out my progress overview here → [Progress.md](https://github.com/ai-nihar/Python_learning/blob/main/Progress.md)

## 🎯 Why This Repo?
- To keep myself consistent in learning Python  
- To track my growth step by step  
- To share my journey with friends and anyone else who wants to learn alongside me
