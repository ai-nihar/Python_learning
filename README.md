# 🐍 My Python Learning Journey

This repository is my **daily log of learning Python**.  
Every day, I create a new folder with the programs I wrote and update `progress.md` with what I learned that day.  

## 📌 How It Works
- Each folder = one day of learning (`Day01/`, `Day02/`, …).  
- `progress.md` = my daily notes and reflections.  
- Code inside each day’s folder = the exercises, examples, or mini-programs I practiced.  

📖 Check out my daily log here → [progress.md](https://github.com/ai-nihar/Python_learning/blob/main/Progress.md)

## 🎯 Why This Repo?
- To keep myself consistent in learning Python.  
- To track my growth step by step.  
- To share my journey with friends and anyone else who wants to learn alongside me.
